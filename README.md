# Personal Space

Welcome to my personal space page!

This personal space is created with jekyll and hosted on github pages.

# Clone me

You can use this theme as it is for your personal space and blog site. Follow below instructions:

* Create a project on github with name "{YOUR_GITHUB_ID}.github.io"
* Clone my project on your local to copy the the directory structure
* Edit ```_config.yml``` and ```_data/bio.yml``` file to reflect your changes
* Delete all blogs under ```_posts``` and ```_drafts``` directories
* Add your posts to ```_posts``` directory
* Push the changes to your origin
* Verify the changes at https://{YOUR_GITHUB_ID}.github.io
